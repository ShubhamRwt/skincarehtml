                <h2 >Why Vitamin A is Touted as a Miracle Skin Ingredient</h2><br><br>

            
                 <h1>
                     Who would have thought that the first letter of the alphabet could cause so much confusion when it comes to skin care ingredients? 
                        
                        Vitamin A is a term for the many related compounds which are also known as retinoids. The vitamin A family is almost as extensive as a big Greek wedding. It includes retinol, retinal or retin-A, retinoids and naturally occurring vitamin A. 
                        
                        Vitamin A and its derivatives are one of the most misunderstood and controversial ingredients. It's implicated in liver toxicity, birth defects and cancer. On the flip side, vitamin A is touted as a miracle skin care ingredient that you shouldn't be without. Whilst vitamin A is essential to our health and well-being, too much of anything can cause issues.  
                        
                        <br><span>What makes vitamin a so effective as an anti-ageing ingredient?</span><br>
                        
                        Vitamin A and its derivatives are known as the gold standard when it comes to incredible skin rejuvenating ingredients. They have more anti-ageing skin benefits than just about any other compound. Dependent on the strength and formulation, retinoids work through the mechanism of inhibiting the enzymes that break down collagen and increase cellular turnover, resulting in a softening of fine lines and wrinkles.
                        
                        Vitamin A can also work to fight acne by dissolving surface oil and diminishing pores, as well as evening out the skin tone by fading dark spots and reducing pigmentation. In short, vitamin A in the correct dosage and formulation, can give you a rosy, glowing complexion.
                        
                       <br> <span>beta-carotene or provitamin a </span><br>
                        
                        Provitamins or natural precursors of vitamin A include alpha carotene, beta-carotene and beta-cryptoxanthin. They are a precursor to vitamin A, which means it converts to vitamin A in the body. 
                        How it works
                        
                        The retinoic acid slow-releases as the retinol in the formula is converted into retinoic acid within the skin. Beta-carotene is known to combat and prevent skin disorders like acne, eczema and psoriasis. It can protect against melasma by affecting the production of skin pigment. It’s a powerful antioxidant and can also protect against sun damage and assist with wound healing, as well as soothing dry and flaky skin. 
                      <br> <span> Retinal (retinaldehyde)</span><br>
                        Retinal or retinaldehyde is the aldehyde form of vitamin A and is purported to be the most effective for your skin. It’s the transitional form of A and is created in the conversion of retinol to retinoid or retinoic acid. 
                        How it works
                        It can assist with minimising the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles. It’s less commonly used in skincare formulations, as this form can be irritating even at very low doses. It should be using sparingly and slowly introduced into your night time routine.
                  <br>  <span>Retinyl palmitate and retinyl acetate </span><br>
                        
                        These are the most common ester forms of vitamin A. They work primarily as antioxidants and convert to retinol. They are more stable in light and are less irritating than retinol, but generally, not as effective. Your body stores around 80% retinyl palmitate as vitamin A found in your skin. 
                        
                   <br> <span>retinoic acid or tretinoin</span><br>
                        Is a prescription-only synthetic derivative of vitamin A. It contains retinoic acid in its purest form. 
                        How it works
                        
                        When applied to the skin, the body can utilise the retinoic acid immediately without having to first metabolise vitamin A. For this reason, it’s classified as a drug. Studies have verified that repeated application of retinoic acid can inhibit collagen breakdown in the presence of UV exposure, reverse the effects of photo ageing, stimulate blood vessels and inhibit precancerous skin cells. It can also reduce visible signs of ageing, but the downside includes inflammation, burning, scaling and peeling that can last for a few weeks. Yikes!
                        
                        This form of A is medical grade and used in a clinical situation as a peel. In higher doses, it's best executed under the guidance of a qualified esthetician or therapist. Take note, you will need some down time and you will need to avoid the sun for some time after this type of peel.
                        
                        (A side note: I tried this type of peel in a professional setting around three years ago and my skin has never quite recovered. Whilst at first, it gave me a fresh, resurfaced canvas, longterm, I believe that this treatment was the catalyst for ongoing dermal impairment and even mild rosacea.)
                   <br> <span>retinol</span><br>
                        Retinol is the alcohol form of vitamin A and is a gentler alternative to retinoic acid. It’s also the most useable form of A and absorbs easily. In its natural form, it’s found in egg yolks and fish liver oil. It’s formed in the body by the hydrolysis of retinyl esters.
                        How it works
                        
                        Retinol is stored until it's required. When applied topically, it’s converted to retinoic acid that works to target free radicals, boost collagen levels and improve cell turnover. It triggers the protein glycosaminoglycan (GAG) production and is thought to stimulate the proliferation of elastin. It can assist with diminishing the signs of ageing by increasing skin thickness, combating acne and reducing sun damage.
                   <br> <span> do you still need to build a tolerance to vitamin a?</span><br>
                        
                        Any forms of A that are listed above are best introduced slowly so that the skin can develop vitamin A receptors to allow for the uptake of retinol. Almost all of the above forms can cause redness, dryness and flaky skin and it can also make your skin more receptive to sun damage.
